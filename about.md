# About me

I believe that happiness in your professional life can be ensured by doing your best at the job and being proud of it. Continuous education is a must as learning keeps going on through the whole life. As an accomplished traveler I love meeting people of different cultures.

Freedom, Respect, Solidarity, Commitment.
